## My process
I started with creating a repository on my Github desktop version.
Went to Blockchainunn repositories and collected the repository which is named Starterkit Https link and cloned it on my Github desktop and saved it in my folder named NFT KIT.
I opened the folder using my Vs code editor app and started workimng on my html, when am done with my html, i opened a new folder and named it css and a file in it naming it style.css, after styling my work with different properties, i saved it and hosted it on Netlify.
It was a rough journey but it was worth my time.

 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

During my time writing this codes for this project, i leant a lot especially when it comes to the function of the margin:auto; it automatically places everything to the middle of the work whike waiting for me to put a width or max-width of my choice.
